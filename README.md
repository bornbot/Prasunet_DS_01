# Project Overview

This project involves analyzing population data from multiple datasets and visualizing various aspects such as population distribution, growth rates, and comparisons between countries. The analysis includes:

- **Histogram of population distribution for a specific year.**
- **Line charts showing population trends over decades.**
- **Visualization of population growth rates.**
- **Pie chart displaying population distribution of the top 10 countries.**

## Files

- `D1.csv`: Main dataset containing population data for various countries over several decades.
- `D2.csv`: Metadata about countries.
- `Metadata_Indicator_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_340326.csv`: Metadata about indicators.
- `DS_01.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and visualizations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Instructions

1. **Loading Data**:
   - Load the datasets using pandas.

2. **Initial Inspection**:
   - Display the first few rows of each dataset to understand their structure.

3. **Population Distribution Histogram**:
   - Extract population data for a specific year (e.g., 2020).
   - Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of populations across countries.

4. **Population Trends Over Decades**:
   - Extract population data for multiple decades.
   - Create line charts to show population trends for selected countries.

5. **Population Growth Rates**:
   - Calculate annual growth rates for selected countries.
   - Create line charts to visualize the growth rates over decades.

6. **Top 10 Countries by Population**:
   - Identify the top 10 most populated countries for a specific year.
   - Create a pie chart to show their population distribution.
